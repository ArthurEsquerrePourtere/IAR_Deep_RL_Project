# IAR_Deep_RL_Project

This repository contains my deep reinforcement learning project, as part of the final year of my master's studies at Sorbonne University.

This project is based on the code of Olivier Sigaud : https://github.com/osigaud/Basic-Policy-Gradient-Labs

You can open the file "rapport_Arthur_Esquerre_Pourtere.pdf" if you want to have a look at the project report (in French...)
